<p>This parameter allows choosing among the registered users an extra user to which the message will be sent.</p>
<p>This setting has global scope, and will trigger emission for all contact forms in this Moodle.</p> 
<p>For sending to an unregistered email, you should ask for creating a disabled account that uses
this address, so user list will give you access to it.</p>
<p>For disabling this emission, leave that list unchoosed.</p>
